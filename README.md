# Ecommerce API

This is a Java-based ecommerce API project built with Spring Boot and containerized using Docker. The project provides a RESTful API for managing ecommerce-related data, including products, customers, orders, and payments. It leverages Postgres for data persistence, Kafka for event-driven communication and Redis for caching.

The Goal of this Fork is to add comprehensive testing, benchmarking, and coverage analysis. It should also integrate multiple security and code-quality tools to ensure the application remains secure and free of vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

To run the API along with its dependencies (Postgres and Kafka), use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file. In the project’s root directory, run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start the API on the port :8081, as well as the required Postgres and Kafka containers.

## API Documentation

The API documentation can be found at <a href="http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html" target="_blank">localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html</a>. This page provides an interactive interface for exploring the API endpoints and testing requests.

## Best Practices

This project follows best practices for software development, including:

* **RESTful API Design**: The API follows standard RESTful principles, including the use of HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-based URLs, standard HTTP status codes and proper error handling.
* **Spring Actuator**: The project uses Spring Actuator to provide production-ready features such as monitoring, metrics, and auditing.
* **Separation of Concerns**: The API is divided into separate modules for each domain entity, making it easy to maintain and extend.
* **Test-Driven Development**: The project includes a comprehensive set of unit tests and integration tests to ensure the API is reliable and stable.
* **Code Quality**: The code is written in a clean, readable, and maintainable style, following standard Java coding conventions.
* **Scalability**: The API is designed to scale horizontally, making it easy to add more instances as traffic increases.
